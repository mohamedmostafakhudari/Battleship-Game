## What is this?

A simple battle ship game.

TOP --> Full Stack JavaScript --> JavaScript --> Testing JavaScript --> Project: Battleship

## What I learned

- OOP principles
- TypeScript
- TDD and Red-Green-Refactor Work Flow
- A new way to use promise and resolve it with user event to allow waiting for the user input
- using await in a for loop
- Problem solving and searching for solutions when stuck.
- and many more...

## Conclusion

Though I've learned a lot building this project, I feel I could have done better. Hence I am planning to do the same project again using React Library later as its component-based style could prove beneficial especially when it comes to readability and the overall organization aspect.
